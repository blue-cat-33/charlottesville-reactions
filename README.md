# Team 33 - Blue Cat 
#### Members: Max Beeson, Liangqi Cai, Divya Rajasekhar, YuYu Madigan

## Project Description

#### We will be working with the [New York Times API](https://developer.nytimes.com/)
as well as a dataset from Kaggle about [Tweets relating to Charlottesville](https://www.kaggle.com/vincela9/charlottesville-on-twitter#aug17_sample.csv
). The New York Times API is created by them and so the data is pulled directly from the source. We will mostly be using data from
August 2017, the time of the Charlottesville protests. The Kaggle daataset allows us to analyze related tweets between August 15-18. It provides data on 
users such as their username, follow counts, retweets, likes, as well as the text of the tweet, hashtags and more. This is a random sample of 50,000 selected tweets.
Additionally, we will use either a Google Maps API or a simiar resource to analyze the geographics of the tweets in relation to Charlottesville.
